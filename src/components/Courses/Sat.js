        The SAT, or Scholastic Assessment Test, is a standardized examination
        widely used for college admissions in the United States. Created by the
        College Board, the SAT is designed to assess a student's readiness for
        college and is an integral component of the college application process.
        The SAT comprises three main sections: Evidence-Based Reading and
        Writing (EBRW), Math, and an optional Essay. The EBRW section evaluates
        critical reading and writing skills through passages and questions that
        assess comprehension, analysis, and vocabulary. The Math section focuses
        on algebra, geometry, and advanced math concepts, testing students'
        quantitative reasoning abilities. The optional Essay, though not
        required by all colleges, allows students to demonstrate their ability
        to analyse and articulate an argument. It presents a passage for
        analysis, and test-takers must evaluate the author's persuasive
        techniques and develop a well-structured response. The SAT is scored on
        a scale of 400 to 1600, combining EBRW and Math scores. The Essay is
        scored separately, ranging from 6 to 24. The test is offered several
        times a year, and students can choose which scores to send to colleges.
        Preparation for the SAT is crucial, and numerous resources, including
        practice tests, study guides, and online courses, are available to help
        students familiarize themselves with the format and content. Some
        students also opt for professional tutoring to enhance their
        performance. Critics argue that the SAT has faced challenges related to
        socio-economic bias and favoritism toward students who can afford test
        preparation. In response, the College Board has made efforts to address
        these concerns, such as introducing a free online test preparation
        platform and moving towards a more contextualized approach to
        admissions. Despite ongoing debates about the role of standardized
        testing in college admissions, the SAT remains a significant factor in
        many institutions' decision-making processes. As of now, the test
        continues to play a pivotal role in assessing students' academic
        capabilities and determining their eligibility for admission to higher
        education institutions in the United States.
